## Requirements

### System Requirements
- **iOS**: 14.6 or later
- **macOS**: 12.0 or later (via Catalyst)
- **Xcode**: 13.0 or later
- **Swift**: 5.5 or later

### CC CC TV Compatibility
- **Works with**: Frigate versions 0.13 through 0.16
- **API Access**: Active Frigate instance with REST API enabled
- **Network**: HTTP/HTTPS access to your Frigate server
- **Authentication**: Compatible with Frigate's authentication mechanisms

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have a running Frigate instance with API enabled
2. Note your Frigate server's base URL (e.g., `http://192.168.0.200:5000`)

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/frigate-events.git
   cd frigate-events
   ```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open "CC CC TV.xcodeproj"
   ```

3. Configure your Frigate server URL in the app settings

4. Build and run on your device or simulator

## Configuration

### Initial Setup

1. Launch the app for the first time
2. Navigate to Settings
3. Enter your Frigate server's base URL
4. Configure notification preferences
5. Select default cameras, labels, and zones to monitor

### API Configuration

The app communicates with Frigate using the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/events` - Retrieve security events
- `GET /api/events/{id}/thumbnail.jpg` - Event thumbnails
- `GET /api/events/{id}/snapshot.jpg` - Full-size snapshots
- `GET /api/events/{id}/clip.mp4` - Video clips
- `GET /api/cameras` - Available cameras
- `GET /api/zones` - Defined zones
- `GET /live/{camera}/index.m3u8` - Live camera streams
- `GET /api/{camera}/latest.jpg` - Real-time snapshots

## Usage

### Viewing Events

- **In-Progress Events**: Real-time events currently being recorded
- **Completed Events**: Historical events with full metadata
- **Event Details**: Tap any event to view full information and media

### Filtering and Search

- **Camera Filter**: Focus on specific cameras
- **Label Filter**: Filter by detection type (person, car, animal, etc.)
- **Zone Filter**: Limit events to specific surveillance zones
- **Time Range**: View events from specific time periods

### Live Camera Feeds

- **Real-time Streaming**: Watch live video from all your cameras
- **Multiple Quality Options**: Choose between high quality, mobile optimized, or MJPEG streams
- **Automatic Fallback**: Seamlessly switches to snapshot mode if live streams are unavailable
- **Expandable Cards**: Tap to expand/collapse individual camera feeds
- **Connection Status**: Visual indicators show stream health and quality

### Media Access

- **Thumbnails**: Quick preview of detected objects
- **Snapshots**: High-resolution images for detailed analysis
- **Video Clips**: Full motion recordings of events

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **FrigateAPIClient**: Handles all API communication with Frigate
- **SettingsStore**: Manages user preferences and configuration
- **EventCardView**: Displays event summaries in the main list
- **EventDetailView**: Shows comprehensive event information
- **VideoPlayerView**: Handles video playback for event clips

### Data Models

- **FrigateEvent**: Core event structure with metadata
- **EventData**: Additional detection information and bounding boxes
- **SettingsStore**: User preferences and configuration state

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**H.265**
- If you camera uses H.265, try: https://github.com/saihgupr/Frigate-Events-H.265-Test

**Connection Errors**
- Verify your Frigate server is running and accessible
- Check network connectivity and firewall settings
- Ensure the API endpoint is correct

**No Events Displayed**
- Verify camera names match your Frigate configuration
- Check that events exist for the selected time range
- Ensure proper API permissions

**Media Not Loading**
- Verify media files exist on the Frigate server
- Check network bandwidth for large files
- Ensure proper authentication if required
